General workflow:

Zillow dataset has zipcodes/permits/etc.

Aggregate permits to show which zipcodes have the most permits for remodeling, electrical/plumbing workclass remodel, addition and remodel workclass.

top 10% pf zipcodes (by permit count) = candidate

Iterate through db, and if zipcode is in 'candidate' list, add 1 to 'YES_CANDIDATE' column; otherwise add 0.

Train model to be accurate with current data and predictive with new datasets.

Once we have a working model based on permits, we can possible look into imcorporating income or property/home value into the model. (??)
